            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>Ever since mtaking my first class of pyisics, and learning electromagnitism, I new that I would want to work ina field that applys these concepts heavily. Choosing electrical engineering was the best choice I could hace done. It has taught me to be eifficient, fast learning, and become a hard worker.</p>
